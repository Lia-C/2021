## Introduction

Machine co-creativity continues to grow and attract a wider audience to machine learning. Generative models, for example, have enabled new types of media creation across language, images, and music--including recent advances such as CLIP, VQGAN, and DALL·E. This one-day workshop will broadly explore topics in the applications of machine learning to creativity and design, which includes:

**State-of-the-art algorithms for the creation of new media**. Machine learning models achieving state-of-the-art in traditional media creation tasks (e.g., image, audio, or video synthesis) that are also being used by the artist community will be showcased.

**Artist accessibility of machine learning models**. Researchers building the next generation of machine learning models for media creation will be challenged in understanding the accessibility needs of artists. Artists and Human Computer interaction / User Experience community members will be encouraged to engage in the conversation.

**The sociocultural and political impact of these new models**. With the increased popularity of generative machine learning models, we are witnessing these models start to impact our everyday surroundings, ranging from racial and gender bias in algorithms and datasets used for media creation to how new media manipulation tools may erode our collective trust in media content.

**Artistic applications**. We will hear directly from some of the artists who are adopting machine learning--including deep learning and reinforcement learning--as part of their own artistic process as well as showcasing their work.  

This workshop will aim to balance addressing the technical issues and challenges of applying the latest machine learning models and techniques to creativity and design with the broader sociocultural and political issues that surround this area of research. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and artists interested in exploring the intersection of human creativity and machine learning and foster collaboration between them, as well as promote the sharing of ideas, perspectives, new research, artwork, and artistic needs.

As in previous years the workshop will include an open call for a display of artworks incorporating machine learning techniques. These works will be collected and presented online, providing a more personal forum for sharing artifacts created with machine learning techniques as well as providing a snapshot of the current creative machine learning landscape to the broader public.

## Invited Speakers

To be announced.

## Schedule

To be announced.

## How To Participate

We invite participation in the form of papers and/or artwork.

### To Submit a Paper

We invite participants to submit 2-page papers in the NeurIPS [camera-ready format](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) (with author names visible), to be submitted to our CMT portal. The link to the portal will be made available soon.

Topics may include (but are not limited to):

* Presentation of new machine learning techniques for generating art, music, or other creative outputs using, for instance, reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, novelty search and evaluation, etc
* Quantitative or qualitative evaluation of machine learning techniques for creative work and design
* Tools or techniques to improve usability or usefulness of machine learning for creative practitioners
* Descriptions, reflections, or case studies on the use of machine learning in the creation of a new art or design work
* Information-theoretic views of creativity
* Aesthetic, philosophical, social, cultural and ethical considerations surrounding the use of machine learning in creative practice

We encourage all authors to consider the ethical implications of their work. This can be discussed in a 1-paragraph section at the end of the paper and will not count towards the page limit.

In your submission, you may also indicate whether you would like to present a demo of your work during the workshop (if applicable).

Papers will be reviewed by committee members in a single-blind process, and accepted authors can present at the workshop in the form of a short talk, panel, and/or demo. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for and attend the workshop. Accepted papers will appear on the workshop website. Please note that we do not adhere to a formal peer review process and are normally unable to provide detailed feedback on individual submissions. We encourage submission of work that has been previously published, and work in progress on relevant topics of the workshop. This workshop will not have an official proceedings.

References and any supplementary materials provided do not count as part of the 2-page limit. However, it will be the reviewers’ discretion to read the supplementary materials.

### To Submit Artwork

We welcome submission of artwork that has been created using machine learning (autonomously or with humans). We invite art submissions in any medium, including but not limited to:

* Image
* Video
* Music
* Writing
* Sound
* Dance, Performance, Installation, Physical Object, Food, etc 

This year we are asking for submissions to consist of:

* A short text description of the work (up to 200 words) in the file project_name_00.txt
* One 1920x1080 "title slide" that includes title, artist, and optionally a short blurb. This will be used as a video intro and only when the text description is not available. (project_name_01.png)
* One 1920x1080 main image (project_name_02.png)
* Optionally: Up to 4 additional 1920x1080 images or a 1920x1080 mp4 video of up to 60 seconds showing the work in more detail. (project_name_03.png, project_name_04.png, project_name_05.png, project_name_06.png *or* project_name_03.mp4)

We will display the accepted art submissions in an online gallery and will do our best to show a number of art pieces at the online workshop itself. We may invite creators of accepted artwork to participate in the form of a short talk, panel, and/or demo.

Submissions must be made through the CMT portal. The submission link will be made available soon. You will also be asked for a short text description of your work and a description of how machine learning was used in its creation.
